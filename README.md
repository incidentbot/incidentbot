## Features

- Organize your efforts into Slack channels to coordinate incident response
- Easy to read messages that get to the point without a ton of visual distractions
- Completely customizable status, severity, and role definitions to control all stages of incident response
- Communicate with the bot using ephemeral messages to keep clutter out of your channels
- Keep the rest of your organization informed with an incident digest channel that explains the state of all incidents
- Integrate with tools you already use like Confluence, Jira, Statuspage, PagerDuty, and Zoom
- Automatically build a postmortem document base to save time
- A web interface for advanced features and organizational capabilities [TBD]

Interested in a web interface to use with Incident Bot? Check out the console project [here](https://github.com/incidentbot/console).

## Quick Start

- [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) for this application. You can name it whatever you'd like.
- Select `from an app manifest` and copy `manifest.yaml` out of this repository and paste it in to automatically configure the app and its required settings. Be sure to override any customizable settings like name, etc.
- You'll need the app token, bot token, and user token for your application and provide those as the `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, and `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` environment variables - these can be found within the app's configuration page in Slack. For more information on Slack tokens, see the documentation [here](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types).
- You'll need a Postgres instance to connect to. If trying the bot out using Docker Compose or Helm, there are options to run a database alongside the app.
- Configure and deploy the application using one of the methods described in the documentation, or however you choose. (There's a Docker image available.)

Full setup documentation is available [here](https://docs.incidentbot.io/installation/).
