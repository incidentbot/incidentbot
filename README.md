## Quick Start

- [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) for this application. You can name it whatever you'd like, but `incident-bot` seems to make the most sense.
- Select `from an app manifest` and copy `manifest.yaml` out of this repository and paste it in to automatically configure the app.
- You'll need the app token, bot token, and user token for your application and provide those as `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, and `SLACK_USER_TOKEN` - these can be found within the app's configuration page in Slack.
- You'll need a Postgres instance to connect to.
- Configure the app using `config.yaml` and deploy it to Kubernetes, Docker, or whichever platform you choose.

[Full setup documentation is available here](https://docs.incidentbot.io/installation/)

You have the option to download source from the latest release and build your own image as well.

### Kubernetes

- You can use [kustomize](https://github.com/echoboomer/incident-bot/blob/main/deploy/kustomize/incident-bot/overlays/development/kustomization.yaml). More details available [here](https://incident-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#kustomize).
- There's optionally a Helm chart - instructions are available [here](https://incident-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html#helm).

## Testing

Tests will run on each pull request and merge to the primary branch. To run them locally:

```bash
make -C backend run-tests
```

## Feedback

This application is not meant to solve every problem with regard to incident management. It was created as an open-source alternative to paid solutions that integrate with Slack.
